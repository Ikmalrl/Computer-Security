## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup (Google Colab)

All source codes were created and tested in **Google Colab**, without any complicated setup.

### üßæ Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have:

* A Google account (to access Colab)
* `pycryptodome` library (for RSA encryption)

### üîß Install Required Library

Run this cell first in your Colab notebook:

```python
!pip install pycryptodome
```

## ü•≠ Running LunarBlaze (Stream Cipher)

**File:** `LunarBlaze.ipynb`
**Concept:** Original stream cipher demonstrating keystream generation, encryption, and decryption.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps in Colab:

1. Open or upload the `LunarBlaze.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells in sequence from top to bottom.
3. Enter your plaintext when prompted.

### üíª Example Output:

```
===== LunarBlaze Stream Cipher =====
Enter plaintext: computer security

Status          : Encryption complete!
Ciphertext (hex): 9c3a37508e0b7b3fd17c0a888799bddbb2
Decrypted text  : computer security

Success: Decryption matches with the plaintext.
```

## ü¶Ö Running WingsDings (Block Cipher)

**File:** `CyberStone.ipynb`
**Concept:** Feistel-based block cipher that uses SHA-256 to generate round keys and PKCS#7 padding for multi-block messages.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps in Colab:

1. Open or upload the `CyberStone.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells sequentially from top to bottom
3. When the program ask for input, enter your plaintext message

### üíª Example Output:

```
===== CyberStone Block Cipher =====
Enter plaintext: computer security

Status          : Encryption complete!
Ciphertext (hex): e632b890ddfb198283f70679847424c4d7d37c84b7bb3892
Decrypted text  : computer security

Success: Decryption matches with the plaintext
```

## üîê Running Hybrid Cryptography Demo

**File:** `Hybrid_cryptography.ipynb`
**Concept:** Combines RSA (asymmetric) for key exchange with CyberStone (symmetric) for fast message encryption. Demonstrates hybrid cryptography for a secure chat application.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps in Colab:

1. Open or upload `Hybrid_Demo_Secure_Chat.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run the notebook step-by-step from top to bottom.
3. When prompted, type a message. "Alice" will encrypt it and "Bob" will decrypt it.

### üíª Example Output:

```
===== Hybrid Cryptography Demo =====
[1] Generating RSA key pair for Bob...
[2] Alice enters message to send securely: Hi Bob!

Encryption complete!
Encrypted session key length: 256 bytes
Encrypted message (hex): e2c84ce0e5e76f59

[3] Bob decrypts the incoming message...

Decryption complete!
Decrypted message: Hi Bob!

Success: Message decrypted correctly.
```
